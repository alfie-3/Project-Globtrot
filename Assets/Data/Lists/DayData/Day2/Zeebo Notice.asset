    By now I''m sure you''ve already
    shipped off many of our iconic <b>Zeebos</b> to our happy customers! Currently,
    we''ve only given you access to 8 of our galaxy-famous Zeebos, but rest assured
    more are on the way! (Not for a while though) Be careful while handling the Zeebo
    Pods however, as they are very fragile and will break if thrown too hard, which
    can hurt the Zeebos. Additionally, customers want the Pods <b>NOT</b> the Zeebos
    themselves. So make sure you only send off the undamaged Pods.


    Thanks for
    handling our Pods!
