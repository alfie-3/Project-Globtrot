    to cultivate our lovely friends The Clugs from NumCo Farms!\nThese friendly critters
    grow eggs that must be harvested by squeezing them out. Do not worry! This does
    not hurt the Clugs much!\nHowever, these space birds are very active and may
    get lost wandering around the warehouse floor, so be sure to keep an eye on them!\n\nMany
    Thunks,\n\nNumCo. Farms ltd."
