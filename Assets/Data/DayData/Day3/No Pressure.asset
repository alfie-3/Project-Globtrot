  content: "Hey team!\n\nJust a heads up, you will now be stocking our universal
    gas cannisters! You will also be supplied with our patented multi-gas pressurising
    machine for filling them up. \n\nMake sure you dont over-pressurising them, because
    they could get quite unstable and- well, no need to worry about that! Just be
    sure to supply the right kind of gas in the order and we'll all be good. \n\nJust
    stay calm and remember, there's No Pressure\u2122! \n"
